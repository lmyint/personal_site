excerpt: "Knowledge moves forward by a continual integration of existing ideas with new findings. The problem nowadays is that there is so much research being conducted that it is difficult to fully be informed about all existing scholarly work. Text (in the form of research publications) is the main mode of storing the rich, interconnected knowledge that we are generating, and it is well appreciated to be a computational nightmare to work with. My goal in this work is to capture the information woven through text in a computable form that holds promise for building more solid future knowledge: graphs. In this talk, I'll discuss my ongoing efforts to use graphs to organize biological information from texts and how these ideas might also be useful for structuring knowledge within the humanities."
