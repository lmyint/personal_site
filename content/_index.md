description: "My storytelling media of choice are **data** and **games**.\n\nAs an Assistant Professor of Statistics at Macalester College, I'm driven by telling **causal** stories, particularly about biology and public health. I'm also passionate about teaching my students to cultivate their data-storytelling skills.\n\nAs a gamer (board, console, tabletop, you name it!), I'm fascinated by the interplay between game structure and story."
