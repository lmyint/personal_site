# About me

I am an Assistant Professor of Statistics at [Macalester College](https://www.macalester.edu/) in the [Department of Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science](https://www.macalester.edu/mscs/). My research interests lie in the application of statistics to study biology (particularly with high-throughput technologies) and human health more broadly. Methodologically, I am interested in using causal inference tools to bridge findings from high-throughput technologies with information about health at the clinical and societal levels. Besides health and biology, I also have interests is human-data interaction: the investigation of how humans interact with data in ways that impact analysis, understanding, and scientific communication. I am also quite excited about graph databases and their ability to model rich, interconnected data (often textual). I am exploring ways to use them to model data in humanities disciplines.

I received my PhD in [biostatistics](http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/) from the [Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health](https://www.jhsph.edu/) where I worked with [Kasper Daniel Hansen](http://www.hansenlab.org/) on statistical methodology for high-throughput biology and with [Jeff Leek](http://jtleek.com/) and [Leah Jager](https://www.jhsph.edu/faculty/directory/profile/2909/leah-r-jager) on understanding the role of human behavior in data analysis.

My last name is pronounced **mee-int**. A common mispronunciation that is quite understandable given the spelling is my-int. While this can be amusing from a computer science perspective, it is, nevertheless, incorrect!
