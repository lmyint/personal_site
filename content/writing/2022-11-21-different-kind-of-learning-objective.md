I vow: this learning objective is going in my syllabi for the spring.

I need my students to feel joy in learning like I need to see my daughter's 6-toothed smile. I've been told that feeling responsible for my students' intrinsic motivation is a high bar.

But I *need* to reach.

Why?

*Memento mori.*

Through the Olympian highs and abyssal lows of my year and a half away from the classroom, this phrase has centered me and suffused me with purpose. In moments where I need it most, it squeezes my finger and arrests me with its frankness and beauty. Like looking up to see my daughter gazing out the window, transfixed by the snowy expanse outside, drinking in the *everythingness* of the world.

Students deserve to experience this kind of beauty. Until now, I had never thought to make this goal explicit. If [feedback loops](https://gradingforgrowth.com/p/the-heart-of-the-loop-reattempts) fuel lasting and meaningful learning, beauty is the ultimate accelerant.

What exactly do I want to cultivate?

- **Inspiration and wonder:** Everyone is naturally curious and observant about issues that, if addressed, could make the world a better place. However, these moments of notice are fleeting, and a path of passion dissipates before even being recognized as such. I want to help students cultivate a habit of *noticing* and *running with those observations* using a data-oriented mindset. "Geez, I wish the city had better bus routes and times." â†’ "I think I could actually make headway on this problem with data!"
- **Collaboration:** "Alice, I had this idea to try to find transportation data to improve the bus system in St. Paul." "I love that idea! What are you thinking?" I want students to develop an instinct to share their ideas with others and *crave* it. Like good news that balloons in your heart and comes out twice as fast and an octave higher than your normal speech. I also want them to be just as giddy hearing about others' ideas and become pro-feedback-givers: able to provide commentary that is thoughtful, actionable, and kind. And I want them to be pro-feedback-receivers: taking reactions with grace and humility.

How will I cultivate these habits?

- **Inspiration and wonder:** I'm planning to give students pocket-sized "noticing journals" (like [these](https://smile.amazon.com/Notepads-Journal-Pocket-Notebooks-Colorful/dp/B09JYMXD6N)) to record their musings. I'll use writing prompts both in and out of class to encourage students to "run" with their wonders with a statistical mindset. Students will be encouraged to note ~2 musings weekly to be prepared for group discussions.
- **Collaboration:** Group discussions will sustain those "runs." With the thoughtful, actionable, and kind feedback of others, students can clarify a data collection and or analysis plan to investigate their curiosities or head down a different path and begin the process anew.

How does all of this fit in with "regular" learning?

- The "traditional" stuff will still be there. I'll still use concept-centered learning objectives and many of the same materials (videos, readings) and learning activities that I have before. I just have to do a little adjustment to allocate regular class time to feedback (likely 15-20 minutes once per week in a course that meets 3 times/week for an hour).
- The goal of the weekly musings and group discussions is primarily to cultivate habits (viewing the world statistically and practicing active listening), but it also lends itself to an authentic project experience. In the past, I've taught courses with either a monolithic semester-long project or a rushed project in the last 3 weeks of the course. These have forced students to choose topics too quickly, with a preference for ease, and without genuine interest. In contrast, a habitual approach to noticing and directed wondering should hopefully promote a deeper connection and sense of ownership with the project experience: the application area is chosen through "ambient" experience and affirmed with the feedback of others.

I want students to engage meaningfully with their learning, and I want them to know that how they *feel* about their learning journey is *directly my top goal*. If I can address the *feeling* of learning well, then I expect that the more "traditional" conceptual learning will come more easily. I *need* to and *will* try. Cowabunga!
