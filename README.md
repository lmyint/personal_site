ABOUT ME:

I am an Assistant Professor of Statistics at Macalester College in the Department of Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science. My research interests lie in the application of statistics to study biology (particularly with high-throughput techonolgies) and human health more broadly. Methodologically, I am interested in using causal inference tools to bridge findings from high-throughput technologies with information about health at the clinical and societal levels. Besides health and biology, I also have interests is human-data interaction: the investigation of how humans interact with data in ways that impact analysis, understanding, and scientific communication. I am also quite excited about graph databases and their ability to model rich, interconnected data (often textual). I am exploring ways to use them to model data in humanities disciplines.

I received my PhD in biostatistics from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health where I worked with Kasper Daniel Hansen on statistical methodology for high-throughput biology and with Jeff Leek and Leah Jager on understanding the role of human behavior in data analysis.

My last name is pronounced mee-int. A common mispronunciation that is quite understandable given the spelling is my-int. While this can be amusing from a computer science perspective, it is, nevertheless, incorrect!
